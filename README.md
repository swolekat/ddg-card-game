# Densha De Go! Card Game

This is a fan translation and conversion of the 1998 Densha De Go! Card game produced by Masudaya. The game is long out of print so I thought a great way to revitalize it would be make a table top sim version of it. Legally speaking I don't own any rights to the game or the Densha De Go! licence so please don't come after me.

If you don't know what Densha De Go! is maybe check out [my video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRJasfqENjY).

**I DON'T KNOW JAPANESE WELL ENOUGH TO TRANSLATE SO PLEASE EXCUSE ANY ERRORS WITH THE MANUAL. IF YOU'D LIKE TO HELP I'D DEFINITELY APPRECIATE IT**
