            When these cards are played, it immediately becomes the turn of the person who is targeted. If the target has an emergency break in their hand they must immediately play it to cancel out the effects and then draw another card to get back to a hand of 4 cards. Otherwise they play their turn normally and then follow the effects of the emergency card.

                There is a slow train ahead and to prevent a collision you must use an emergency break! Until you use an emergency break, every turn remove the distance card underneath this one. If there are no distance cards left, and just the station, discard the station and this card.
